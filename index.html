	<h1>Async::DNS</h1><p>Async::DNS is a high-performance DNS client resolver and server which can be easily integrated into other projects or used as a stand-alone daemon. It was forked from <a href="https://github.com/ioquatix/rubydns">RubyDNS</a> which is now implemented in terms of this library.</p>

<section id="installation"><h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Add this line to your application's Gemfile:</p>
<pre><code>gem 'async-dns'
</code></pre>
<p>And then execute:</p>
<pre><code>$ bundle
</code></pre>
<p>Or install it yourself as:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install async-dns
</code></pre>
</section><section id="usage"><h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Please browse the <a href="source/index.html">source code index</a> or refer to the guides below.</p>


</section><section id="resolver"><h3>Resolver</h3>
<p>Here is a simple example showing how to use the resolver:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">	Async::Reactor.run do
		resolver = Async::DNS::Resolver.new([[:udp, &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;, 53], [:tcp, &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;, 53]])

		addresses = resolver.addresses_for(&quot;www.google.com.&quot;)

		puts addresses.inspect
	end
	=&gt; [#&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.240&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.216&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.223&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.227&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.234&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.230&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.208&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.249&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.219&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.218&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.212&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.241&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.238&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.245&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.251&gt;, #&lt;Resolv::IPv4 202.124.127.229&gt;]
</code></pre>
</section><section id="server"><h3>Server</h3>
<p>Here is a simple example showing how to use the server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">	require 'async/dns'
	
	class TestServer &lt; Async::DNS::Server
		def process(name, resource_class, transaction)
			@resolver ||= Async::DNS::Resolver.new([[:udp, '8.8.8.8', 53], [:tcp, '8.8.8.8', 53]])
			
			transaction.passthrough!(@resolver)
		end
	end
	
	server = TestServer.new([[:udp, '127.0.0.1', 2346]])
	
	server.run
</code></pre>
<p>Then to test you could use <code>dig</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>dig @localhost -p 2346 google.com
</code></pre>
</section><section id="faq"><h2>FAQ</h2>
</section><section id="file-handle-limitations"><h3>File Handle Limitations</h3>
<p>I get the error <code>Errno::EMFILE: Too many open files - socket(2) - udp</code> when trying to run a server. What should I do?</p>
<p>On some platforms (e.g. Mac OS X) the number of file descriptors is relatively low by default and should be increased by calling <code>ulimit -n 10000</code> before running tests or even before starting a server which expects a large number of concurrent incoming connections.</p>
</section><section id="server"><h3>Server</h3>
<p>The performance is on the same magnitude as <code>bind9</code>. Some basic benchmarks resolving 1000 names concurrently, repeated 5 times, using <code>Async::DNS::Resolver</code> gives the following:</p>
<pre><code>                              user     system      total        real
Async::DNS::Server         4.280000   0.450000   4.730000 (  4.854862)
Bind9                         4.970000   0.520000   5.490000 (  5.541213)
</code></pre>
<p>These benchmarks are included in the unit tests. To test bind9 performance, it must be installed and <code>which named</code> must return the executable.</p>
</section><section id="performance"><h2>Performance</h2>
<p>We welcome additional benchmarks and feedback regarding Async::DNS performance. To check the current performance results, consult the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/socketry/async-dns">travis build job output</a>.</p>
</section><section id="resolver"><h3>Resolver</h3>
<p>The <code>Async::DNS::Resolver</code> is highly concurrent and can resolve individual names as fast as the built in <code>Resolv::DNS</code> resolver. Because the resolver is asynchronous, when dealing with multiple names, it can work more efficiently:</p>
<pre><code>                              user     system      total        real
Async::DNS::Resolver       0.020000   0.010000   0.030000 (  0.030507)
Resolv::DNS                   0.070000   0.010000   0.080000 (  1.465975)
</code></pre>
<p>These benchmarks are included in the unit tests.</p>
